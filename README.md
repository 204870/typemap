# typemap
An OOP Project surrounding Pokemon Type weaknesses and resistances

If you go to src/typematrix thats how you run it I don't make the rules except I did make the rules in this case uh-oh

Future endeavors include making it look pretty and showing a visually intuitive representation of the generated adjacency matrices and having users make their own "types" and see how they interact with the 18 existing types

Okay thank you bye
